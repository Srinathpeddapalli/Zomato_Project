# Restaurant Location Analysis Project using Excel

## Overview
This Excel project aimed to identify optimal locations for new restaurant openings and analyze key success factors such as ratings and cuisine preferences. The project provided strategic insights for Zomato's expansion by focusing on low-competition areas with average ratings below 4, ensuring a higher success rate for new restaurant ventures. Additionally, correlation analysis was implemented between cost and ratings to inform attractive pricing strategies for cuisine references, aiming to boost customer engagement. Furthermore, a two-step analysis on cuisine ratings was conducted, guiding country-specific restaurant decisions based on local preferences, while the second step offered global-level cuisine choices.
